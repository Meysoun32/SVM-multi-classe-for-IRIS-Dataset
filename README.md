# SVM-multi-classe-for-IRIS-Dataset
 This project uses a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the IRIS dataset, which includes measurements of iris flower species. The model distinguishes between three species based on features like petal and sepal length and width, with its performance evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics.
